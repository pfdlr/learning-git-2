            Life, it seems, will fade away<br>
            Drifting further every day<br>
            Getting lost within myself<br>
            Nothing matters, no one else<br>
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            I have lost the will to live<br>
            Simply nothing more to give<br>
            There is nothing more for me<br>
            Need the end to set me free<br>
        </p>
        <p class="left">
            Things not what they used to be<br>
            Missing one inside of me<br>
            Deathly lost, this can't be real<br>
            Cannot stand this hell I feel<br>
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Emptiness is filling me<br>
            To the point of agony<br>
            Growing darkess taking dawn<br>
            I was me, but now he's gone<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            No one but me can save myself, but it's too late
            Now I can't think, think why I should even try</p>
        <p>
            Yesterday seems as though it never existed
            Death greets me warm
            Now I will just say goodbye 
        </p>
